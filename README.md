## How It Works
<p>First, users are to register or login, which was developed using Express and Passport.js. These packages helped to hash user passwords and create cookies for user authentication.</p>
<p>When logged in, users are then able to create, edit, and delete journal entries.</p>
<p>Users' entries are private and posts can only be seen by their owners.</p>
